## Executive Summary
This repository serves as a version-controlled technical portfolio. On February 25, 2026, I successfully initialized a standardized cybersecurity workbench, integrating **VS Code**, **Git**, and **GitHub**.

## Verification
This commit verifies that my local environment is successfully authenticated with my remote repository and that I can perform secure data transfers via the Git protocol.

## Security Foundations: Governance & Frameworks

### CIA Triad
The CIA Triad represents the three core objectives of cybersecurity: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals. Integrity protects data from unauthorized modification and ensures accuracy and reliability. Availability ensures that systems and information remain accessible when needed. These principles form the foundation of modern cybersecurity frameworks and risk management practices (National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST], 2018).

### AAA Framework
The AAA Framework stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. Authentication verifies the identity of a user or system before access is granted. Authorization determines what level of access or permissions are allowed after identity verification. Accounting records user activities to ensure traceability and accountability. Together, AAA strengthens access control and monitoring within secure systems.

### Governance and Cybersecurity Roles
Governance establishes the policies, standards, and oversight that guide cybersecurity operations. It defines how security controls are implemented, monitored, and evaluated. Governance influences cybersecurity roles by assigning responsibility, ensuring compliance with regulations, and aligning security strategies with organizational objectives. Without governance, technical controls lack structure, accountability, and measurable effectiveness.

## Reflection
Governance is just as important as technical skill in cybersecurity because it provides the structure and accountability that guide technical implementation. Technical skills allow professionals to configure systems and defend networks, but governance ensures those actions align with risk management and compliance requirements. Without governance, security efforts may be inconsistent or misaligned with organizational goals. Today’s material aligns most closely with the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) domain because it focuses on frameworks such as CIA and AAA rather than purely technical network configuration. Understanding governance strengthens strategic decision-making and supports long-term security resilience.
